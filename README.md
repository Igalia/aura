What is it?
-----------

Aura is an open source application for N9 and N950 devices using MeeGo/Harmattan. With Aura you can record videos from the mobile's camera, applying fancy special effects.

Aura is inspired in [Cheese](http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/) and uses many of the effects avialable in [Gnome Video Effects](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeVideoEffects).
